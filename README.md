This project implements semi-supervised image classification using contrastive pretraining with SimCLR in TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following structure:

- **data_processing:** Contains scripts and notebooks related to data preprocessing.
- **model_training:** Contains scripts and notebooks for training the SimCLR model.
- **evaluation:** Contains scripts and notebooks for evaluating the trained model.

- **.gitignore:** Specifies which files and directories to exclude from version control.
- **LICENSE:** The license file for the project.
- **README.md:** This file, providing an overview of the project.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists the dependencies required to run the code.
